## Introduction ‚ÑπÔ∏è

Numerical methods are essential tools used to solve mathematical problems that may not have exact solutions or are difficult to solve analytically. These methods involve approximating solutions using iterative techniques, numerical integration, interpolation, and more.

This repository serves as a collection of lab practicals conducted during numerical methods courses. Each practical focuses on a specific numerical method, providing implementation examples in the C programming language.

## List of Practicals üìã

Here's the list of numerical methods covered in this repository:

1. Euler's Method
2. Heun's Method
3. Runge-Kutta Method
4. Gaussian Quadrature
5. Jacobi Iteration Method
6. Gauss-Seidel Method
7. Trapezoidal Rule
8. Simpson's 1/3 Rule
9. Simpson's 3/8 Rule
10. Gaussian Elimination Method
11. Gauss-Jordan Method
12. LU Decomposition using Doolittle Algorithm
13. Poisson's Equation Solver
14. And more!

Feel free to explore each practical to understand how these numerical methods are implemented in C.

## Usage üöÄ
